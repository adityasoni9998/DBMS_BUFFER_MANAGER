# Implementing the DBMS Buffer Manager

C++ source code for the Database Management Systems Lab project. This project implemented the Buffer Manager fetches pages from the disk into memory (if needed). It also decides which pages to write back into the disk to create space for new data using various algorithms (LRU, MRU, Clock).

## Instructions

Run the commands "g++ main.cpp defs.cpp" followed by "./a.out". For demonstration purposes, we have kept two txt files (dbms.txt and networks.txt) as sample tables to perform SELECT and JOIN operations on.
